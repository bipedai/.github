<details> <summary>:warning: New dependencies ⚠️ </summary>
    
If your PR requires new dependencies check:

- That the source dependencies (`pip`, `npm` ...) have a permissive licence if they are to be used in production
- The system dependenices (`apt`) are already installed on the boards
- Notify the #software channel so that all dev environments are updated

Ask @Polymere in case of doubt.
